# CLINAC MCNP Simulation Plan

- Generate input decks
    - get geometry from .geo file
    - get cells from .cell file
    - get materials from .matl, .matld, .matlc file
    - get tallies from .tallyp, .tallyn files
    - get physics from .physp, .physn files
    - take total pnps and divide by 1E9
        - create pnps/1E9 files
        - create a random number and put in files w/ whatever card
        - name as clinac_no_target_h2/c13_p_num.inp
- Run decks
    - run on cores from j, back to back if not enough cores
    - wait for first check, then calculate the total time (progress bar(s))
    - on p ending, send email
    - combine photo files
    - start n simulation with the combined photo file
- Visualize decks
    - plot geometry with matplotlib from .geo file
    - find all points of photo-neutron interaction with loadtxt
    - find the density chart with voxels
    - plot volumetric density chart using python library yt
    - superimpose and save to file
